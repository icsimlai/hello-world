POCs on various Subjects and Technologies are stored in this Repository
I have started exploring the Azure Functions and Serverless Computing. I will be doing following things:
Tasks:
-----
1) Do R & D on "Azure Functions" and the "ServerLess Computing" technology, 
2) Develop guidance on the kinds of Microservices workloads that can we expect to run in an event driven serverless architecture
3) Find out what class of applications can be developed given the stateless episodic nature of serverless computing. 
4) Review of findings with SME, prepare a short demo and 1-5 ppt slides.
